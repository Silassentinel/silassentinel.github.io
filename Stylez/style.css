Specificity Hierarchy

Every CSS selector has its place in the specificity hierarchy.

There are four categories which define the specificity level of a selector:

    Inline styles - Example: <h1 style="color: pink;">
    IDs - Example: #navbar
    Classes, pseudo-classes, attribute selectors - Example: .test, :hover, [href]
    Elements and pseudo-elements - Example: h1, ::before

There are four different combinators in CSS:

    descendant selector (space)
    child selector (>)
    adjacent sibling selector (+)
    general sibling selector (~)
